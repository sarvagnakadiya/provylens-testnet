## About

**ProvyLens**: A Decentralized Supply Chain Management System
provyLens is a blockchain-based supply chain management system designed for Web3. Leveraging the power of blockchain technology, the platform creates a tamper-proof, decentralized ledger that tracks every step of the supply chain, from raw material sourcing to production, distribution, and retail.

Each product is assigned a unique identifier that can be traced back to its origin, providing users with the ability to verify its authenticity and ensuring that it has not been tampered with or counterfeited. The platform also incorporates smart contracts to automate supply chain operations, reduce costs, and increase efficiency, while maintaining transparency and accountability throughout the process.

Built with React and other JS libraries for the frontend and Solidity smart contracts deployed on **Scroll** and **Polygon-Mumbai** Blockchain for storing and fetching the events, provyLens also utilizes **subgraphs** created with **The Graph** for faster querying and indexing of emitted contract events. The system utilizes Hardhat for working with smart contracts and **Push protocol** for sending notifications and providing a chat feature.

provyLens aims to improve trust and confidence in the products consumers purchase, while also reducing waste, fraud, and environmental impact. By providing a reliable and transparent supply chain, provyLens delivers a new level of transparency and trust without revealing crucial information.
